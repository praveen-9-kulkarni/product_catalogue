# Product Catalogue DTOs

This module contains Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for the Product Catalogue application. These DTOs are designed to be used for data exchange between the service and its clients.

## Purpose

The main purposes of this module are:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping DTOs separate from the domain model
2. **API Stability**: Providing a stable API contract for clients
3. **Reusability**: Allowing other services to use these DTOs without depending on the entire application
4. **Versioning**: Enabling independent versioning of the API contract

## Available DTOs

### ProductDTO

Used for transferring complete product information, including the ID.

```java
public class ProductDTO {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private Double price;
    private String category;
    private String imageUrl;
}
```

### ProductCreateDTO

Used for creating new products. Does not include an ID as it's generated by the service.

```java
public class ProductCreateDTO {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private Double price;
    private String category;
    private String imageUrl;
}
```

### ProductUpdateDTO

Used for updating existing products. All fields are optional, and only the provided fields will be updated.

```java
public class ProductUpdateDTO {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private Double price;
    private String category;
    private String imageUrl;
}
```

## Mapper Interface

The module also includes a `ProductMapper` interface that defines methods for converting between DTOs and domain entities. This interface should be implemented in the main application module.

## Usage

To use this module in your project, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.learn.product_catalogue:product-catalogue-dto:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
```

## Publishing

This module is configured for publishing to a Maven repository. To publish it, run:

```bash
./gradlew :product-catalogue-dto:publish
```
